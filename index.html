        <p>Digital image watermarking is applied today as a popular technique for authentication and copyright protection of image data. Based on global information
            about the image characteristics, many approaches and commercial solutions embed the watermarking signal as random noise in the whole cover image with the
            same strength regardless of the local properties of the image. This embedding
            may lead in practice to visible artifacts specially in the flat regions which are
            characterized by small variability. In order to decrease these distortions the given
            watermark strength has to be decreased. This, however, reduces drastically the
            robustness of the watermark against different sorts of attacks, since the image
            regions which generate the most visible artifacts determine the final maximum
            strength of the watermark signal to be embedded.</p>
